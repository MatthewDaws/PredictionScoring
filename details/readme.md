# Details

Jupyter notebooks and code used in the article.

- [`Toy model.ipynb`](Toy%20model.ipynb) : Studied and produces plots from the "toy model" which is just two grid cells.
- [`Further details for toy model.ipynb`](Further%20details%20for%20toy%20model.ipynb) : Explores a couple of further points for the toy model.
- [`Synthetic Data.ipynb`](Synthetic%20Data.ipynb) : Produces all the analysis and plots for the synthetic examples (i.e. real geometry, but artifical and known probability distributions of events)
- [`Chicago case study.ipynb`](Chicago%20case%20study.ipynb) : A tiny bit of extra investigation of the real-world data.
- [`Burglary data.ipynb`](Burglary%20data.ipynb) : Produces the predictions, analysis, and plots for the real-world data from Chicago.
- [`Hit rates.ipynb`](Hit%20rates.ipynb) : Looks at the hit rate and hit count data produced from the previous notebook.
- [`Burglary data - Different dates.ipynb`](Burglary%20data%20-%20Different%20dates.ipynb) : Same as the Chicago case study, but for different dates (and doesn't save anything)
- [`Burglary data - Southside.ipynb`](Burglary%20data%20-%20Southside.ipynb) : Ditto, but for data from the South Side of Chicago instead of the North side.
- [`Hierarchical Hit Counts.ipynb`](Hierarchical%20Hit%20Counts.ipynb) : Look at a hierarchical model for hit rates, and produces plots for the paper.
- [`Hierarchical Hit Counts 1.ipynb`](Hierarchical%20Hit%20Counts%201.ipynb) : Same again, but via MCMC methods.
