# Prediction Scoring

We work within the framework of spatial "predictive policing": the generation of
short range (for example, the next day) predictions or forecasts of crime locations within,
say, a city.  We survey methods of comparing such predictions as given by predictive policing
algorithms.  We discuss a framework for thinking about the problem, and provide some new
comparison methods.  We develop the framework with a "toy" model, via computer simulation
of synthetic data, and with a case-study using real data.
